            <p>1. Choose the right bamboo for your growing conditions.
                2. Plant bamboo in full to partial sun when you plant other warm-weather flowers and vegetables.
                3 Prepare the soil by adding Miracle-Gro All Purpose Garden Soil.
                4. Water plants thoroughly at the time of planting and throughout the season.</p>

            <p>Leatherleaf sedge prefers spring planting. Dig a hole about 6 inches wider than the nursery container
                 and no deeper than the depth of the container. Place the plant in the hole and make sure the root 
                 crown is slightly above soil level. Backfill the hole with soil and gently tamp it down.</p>

            <p>All you need is a pot, some and some filtered water or rainwater. First, you have to soak the the live
                 moss in water for about 30 minutes. After that, squeeze out the excess water and place it in the pot.
                  Now all you have to do is water it regularly and place it in a bright spot, but not in direct sunlight.</p>

            <p>1. Choose a location with well-draining soil and full sun.
                2. Dig a hole that is at least twice as wide as the root ball of the seedling, and just as deep.
                3. Remove the seedling from its container and loosen any tangled roots.</p>

            <p>Let the seed soak in water for 48 hours and spread the seed across starting soil in a tray.
                 Keep the soil moist by misting them and leaving the tray in bright indirect sunlight.
                  It should take about two weeks for the seed to germinate.</p>
