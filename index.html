          <h3>Why Trees Matter:</h3>
          <p class="def">Did you know that trees are nature's superheroes? They don't wear capes, but they
             do something even more remarkable. <br>They purify the air we breathe and safeguard our 
             precious ozone layer. Through photosynthesis, trees absorb harmful carbon dioxide <br> 
             and release life-giving oxygen, mitigating the effects of pollution and climate 
             change. Additionally, their presence plays <br> a crucial role in protecting the ozone 
             layer, Earth's natural sunscreen, from further depletion.</p>
